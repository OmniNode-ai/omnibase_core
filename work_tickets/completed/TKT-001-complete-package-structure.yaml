title: "Complete Package Structure with Missing __init__.py Files"
epic: "EPIC-001-core-framework-stabilization"

type: "bug_fix"

# Problem Statement
problem_statement: |
  Package structure analysis reveals one missing __init__.py file out of 49 directories in src/.
  This creates an incomplete Python package structure that could cause import issues and 
  prevent proper module discovery.

# Business Impact
business_impact:
  severity: "medium"
  scope: "development"
  description: "Missing __init__.py files can cause unpredictable import behavior and prevent proper package initialization"

# Requirements
functional_requirements:
  - Find missing __init__.py file in src/omnibase directory structure
  - Create missing __init__.py file with proper ONEX imports and exports
  - Validate all directories have proper package initialization
  - Ensure package discovery works correctly across all modules

non_functional_requirements:
  - Changes must not break existing imports
  - Package structure must follow Python packaging best practices
  - All __init__.py files must use consistent import patterns

# Acceptance Criteria
acceptance_criteria:
  - [ ] All 49 directories in src/omnibase have __init__.py files
  - [ ] Missing __init__.py file is created with proper module exports
  - [ ] Package can be imported without errors: `import omnibase`
  - [ ] All sub-modules can be imported correctly
  - [ ] No circular import dependencies exist

# Definition of Done
definition_of_done:
  - [ ] All directories have __init__.py files (verified with find command)
  - [ ] Python import tests pass for all modules
  - [ ] Package structure validation script passes
  - [ ] No ruff import errors or warnings
  - [ ] Changes committed with clear message

# ONEX Compliance
onex_compliance:
  standards_checklist:
    - [ ] No `Any` types used (N/A - file creation only)
    - [ ] Proper OnexError usage (N/A)
    - [ ] Contract-driven architecture (N/A)
    - [ ] Registry pattern compliance (N/A)
    - [ ] Duck typing protocols (N/A)
    - [ ] ONEX naming conventions (file and module names)
    - [ ] Quality gates implemented (import validation)
    - [ ] No AI attribution in commits

# Technical Implementation
implementation_plan:
  - step: "Identify missing __init__.py file location"
    details: "Use find command to locate directory without __init__.py"
  - step: "Analyze directory purpose and required exports"
    details: "Determine what should be exposed from the missing package"
  - step: "Create __init__.py with appropriate content"
    details: "Add proper imports and __all__ exports if needed"
  - step: "Validate package structure"
    details: "Test imports and run package discovery validation"

# Risk Assessment
risks:
  - risk: "Breaking existing imports"
    probability: "low"
    impact: "medium"
    mitigation: "Test all imports before and after changes"
  - risk: "Circular import creation"
    probability: "very_low" 
    impact: "high"
    mitigation: "Use relative imports and avoid cross-dependencies"

# Success Metrics
success_metrics:
  - metric: "Package completeness"
    target: "100% (49/49 directories with __init__.py)"
    measurement: "find command count verification"
  - metric: "Import success rate"
    target: "100% successful imports"
    measurement: "Python import tests for all modules"

# Files Involved
files_involved:
  - path: "src/omnibase/[missing_directory]/__init__.py"
    type: "create"
    description: "Missing package initialization file"

# Test Plan
test_plan:
  unit_tests: []
  integration_tests:
    - "Import all omnibase modules successfully"
    - "Verify package discovery with pkg_resources"
  validation_tests:
    - "Run ruff import checking"
    - "Execute Python -m omnibase (if applicable)"

# Notes
notes: |
  This is a foundational fix that ensures proper Python packaging.
  Should be completed first as other tickets may depend on proper imports.
