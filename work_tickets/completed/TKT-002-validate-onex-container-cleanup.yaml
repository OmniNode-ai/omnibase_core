title: "Validate ONEXContainer Legacy Registry Cleanup"
epic: "EPIC-001-core-framework-stabilization"
phase: "Phase 1 - Core Functionality"
type: "validation"
priority: "high"
status: "completed"
complexity: "medium"
estimated_hours: 4

# Problem Statement
problem_statement: |
  README.md mentions removing legacy registry dependencies from ONEXContainer, but analysis 
  shows the current implementation appears clean. Need thorough validation to ensure no 
  legacy registry references remain and that protocol-based resolution works correctly.

# Business Impact
business_impact:
  severity: "high"
  scope: "architecture"
  description: "Legacy registry dependencies would violate ONEX protocol-driven DI principles and create technical debt"

# Requirements
functional_requirements:
  - Comprehensive audit of ONEXContainer for any legacy registry references
  - Validate protocol-based service resolution works correctly
  - Ensure no specialized_registries or legacy imports remain
  - Test container with realistic protocol scenarios
  - Document clean protocol-based patterns

non_functional_requirements:
  - ONEXContainer must use ONLY protocol-based resolution
  - No coupling to legacy registry systems
  - Clean separation of concerns with single responsibility
  - Performance must be acceptable for DI resolution

# Acceptance Criteria
acceptance_criteria:
  - [x] No legacy registry imports or references in ONEXContainer
  - [x] Protocol-based service resolution works for common protocols
  - [x] Container supports protocol shortcuts (event_bus -> ProtocolEventBus)
  - [x] Proper OnexError handling for unresolved services
  - [x] Container configuration works without registry dependencies
  - [x] Unit tests validate clean protocol-based behavior

# Definition of Done
definition_of_done:
  - [x] Code audit completed with clean bill of health
  - [x] Protocol-based resolution validated with tests
  - [x] Container handles missing services gracefully
  - [x] Documentation updated to reflect clean architecture
  - [x] No TODO comments related to registry cleanup
  - [x] Example usage patterns documented

# ONEX Compliance
onex_compliance:
  standards_checklist:
    - [x] No `Any` types used (validate existing usage is appropriate)
    - [x] Proper OnexError usage (validate error handling patterns)
    - [x] Contract-driven architecture (protocol-based DI validation)
    - [x] Registry pattern compliance (ensure no legacy registry coupling)
    - [x] Duck typing protocols (validate protocol resolution)
    - [x] ONEX naming conventions (validate method and variable names)
    - [x] Quality gates implemented (comprehensive testing)
    - [x] No AI attribution in commits

# Notes
notes: |
  This validation is critical for ensuring the core DI container follows
  ONEX protocol-driven principles without legacy coupling. The container
  is the foundation for all node implementations.
