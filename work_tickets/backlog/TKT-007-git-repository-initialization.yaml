title: "Validate Git Repository Setup and Commit History"
epic: "EPIC-001-core-framework-stabilization"
phase: "Phase 2 - Development Infrastructure" 
type: "validation"
priority: "low"
status: "backlog"
complexity: "low"
estimated_hours: 2

# Problem Statement
problem_statement: |
  README.md mentions git repository initialization, but git status shows the repository
  is already initialized with clean commit history. Need validation that git setup
  is proper and includes necessary configuration for ONEX development.

# Business Impact
business_impact:
  severity: "low"
  scope: "development"
  description: "Proper git setup ensures good development workflow and version control practices"

# Requirements
functional_requirements:
  - Validate git repository is properly initialized
  - Ensure .gitignore includes appropriate exclusions
  - Verify git configuration supports ONEX development workflow
  - Check commit history is clean and properly structured
  - Validate branch structure and naming conventions

non_functional_requirements:
  - Git operations must be fast and reliable
  - Repository structure must support collaborative development
  - Commit history must be clean and maintainable

# Acceptance Criteria
acceptance_criteria:
  - [ ] Git repository is properly initialized and functional
  - [ ] .gitignore excludes appropriate files (Python cache, IDE files, etc.)
  - [ ] Git configuration includes proper user settings and aliases
  - [ ] Commit history follows ONEX commit message conventions
  - [ ] Branch structure supports feature development workflow
  - [ ] Pre-commit hooks are configured and functional

# Definition of Done
definition_of_done:
  - [ ] Git status shows clean working directory
  - [ ] All necessary files are tracked appropriately
  - [ ] .gitignore is comprehensive and tested
  - [ ] Git hooks are configured for ONEX compliance
  - [ ] Repository documentation includes git workflow
  - [ ] Branch protection and workflow are documented

# ONEX Compliance
onex_compliance:
  standards_checklist:
    - [ ] No `Any` types used (N/A)
    - [ ] Proper OnexError usage (N/A)
    - [ ] Contract-driven architecture (N/A)
    - [ ] Registry pattern compliance (N/A)
    - [ ] Duck typing protocols (N/A)
    - [ ] ONEX naming conventions (branch and commit naming)
    - [ ] Quality gates implemented (pre-commit hooks)
    - [ ] No AI attribution in commits (git hook validation)

# Technical Implementation
implementation_plan:
  - step: "Audit current git configuration"
    details: "Review repository setup, remotes, and configuration"
  - step: "Validate .gitignore completeness"
    details: "Ensure all appropriate files are excluded"
  - step: "Check commit history and message quality"
    details: "Verify existing commits follow good practices"
  - step: "Configure git hooks if needed"
    details: "Set up pre-commit hooks for quality gates"
  - step: "Document git workflow"
    details: "Create clear guidelines for contributors"

# Risk Assessment
risks:
  - risk: "Missing important .gitignore entries"
    probability: "low"
    impact: "low"
    mitigation: "Review common Python and IDE ignore patterns"
  - risk: "Inadequate commit message standards"
    probability: "low"
    impact: "low"
    mitigation: "Document and enforce commit message conventions"

# Success Metrics
success_metrics:
  - metric: "Git functionality validation"
    target: "100% git operations working correctly"
    measurement: "Git command execution tests"
  - metric: "File tracking accuracy"
    target: "All appropriate files tracked/ignored correctly"
    measurement: "Git status and .gitignore validation"

# Notes
notes: |
  This is primarily a validation ticket as git is already initialized.
  Focus on ensuring best practices and ONEX compliance in git workflow.
