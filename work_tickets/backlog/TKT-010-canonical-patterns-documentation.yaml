# Problem Statement
problem_statement: |
  Example implementations demonstrate canonical ONEX patterns but lack comprehensive
  documentation that extracts and explains these patterns for ONEX tool developers.
  Need authoritative documentation of architectural patterns, best practices, and
  implementation guidelines.

# Business Impact
business_impact:
  severity: "medium"
  scope: "documentation"
  description: "Proper documentation enables consistent ONEX tool development across the ecosystem"

# Requirements
functional_requirements:
  - Extract canonical patterns from validated example implementations
  - Document 4-node architecture patterns with concrete examples
  - Create developer guide for ONEX tool implementation
  - Document protocol-based DI patterns and best practices
  - Provide error handling and OnexError usage guidelines
  - Create troubleshooting guide for common implementation issues

non_functional_requirements:
  - Documentation must be clear and actionable for developers
  - Examples must be current and demonstrate best practices
  - Documentation must be maintainable and versioned
  - Content must be searchable and well-organized

# ONEX Compliance
onex_compliance:
  standards_checklist:
    - [ ] No `Any` types used (documentation examples use proper typing)
    - [ ] Proper OnexError usage (document correct error patterns)
    - [ ] Contract-driven architecture (document contract patterns)
    - [ ] Registry pattern compliance (document DI patterns)
    - [ ] Duck typing protocols (document protocol usage)
    - [ ] ONEX naming conventions (document naming standards)
    - [ ] Quality gates implemented (document testing patterns)
    - [ ] No AI attribution in commits
  compliance_notes: "Documentation must demonstrate and enforce ONEX compliance standards"
