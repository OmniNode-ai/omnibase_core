# Problem Statement
problem_statement: |
  Node base classes (Effect, Compute, Reducer, Orchestrator) need comprehensive testing
  to validate they correctly implement ONEX architecture patterns, handle initialization
  properly, and provide the promised 80+ line boilerplate reduction while maintaining
  type safety and error handling.

# Business Impact
business_impact:
  severity: "high"
  scope: "architecture"
  description: "Base class reliability is critical as all ONEX tools depend on these foundations"

# Requirements
functional_requirements:
  - Test all 4 node base classes thoroughly with realistic scenarios
  - Validate boilerplate elimination claims (80+ lines reduction)
  - Test ONEXContainer integration with each node type
  - Validate protocol-based service resolution within nodes
  - Test error handling and OnexError propagation patterns
  - Create performance benchmarks for node initialization
  - Test mixin functionality and inheritance patterns

non_functional_requirements:
  - Tests must validate type safety and protocol compliance
  - Performance tests must confirm acceptable overhead
  - Tests must be maintainable and serve as documentation
  - Error scenarios must be comprehensive and realistic

  - [ ] All mixins (health check, introspection, etc.) are tested
  - [ ] Error handling patterns are validated with realistic scenarios
  - [ ] Performance benchmarks confirm acceptable initialization overhead

# Notes
notes: |
  This testing validates the core promise of ONEX: that base classes
  eliminate 80+ lines of boilerplate while maintaining type safety and
  performance. These tests serve as both validation and documentation
  of proper ONEX node implementation patterns.
