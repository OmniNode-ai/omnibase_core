title: "Configure and Validate Code Quality Tools (ruff, mypy, black)"

# Problem Statement
problem_statement: |
  Code quality tools are configured in pyproject.toml but need validation and optimization
  for ONEX development patterns. Current configuration may not catch ONEX-specific
  issues or may have excessive noise that blocks development productivity.

# Business Impact
business_impact:
  severity: "medium"
  scope: "quality"
  description: "Proper code quality tools ensure consistent code standards and catch issues early"

# Requirements
functional_requirements:
  - Validate ruff configuration works with ONEX codebase
  - Configure mypy for strict type checking with protocol support
  - Ensure black formatting aligns with ONEX conventions
  - Create pre-commit hooks for automated quality checks
  - Configure tools to work together without conflicts

non_functional_requirements:
  - Quality checks must complete in reasonable time (<30 seconds)
  - Tools must support ONEX protocol patterns and duck typing
  - Configuration must be maintainable and documented
  - Quality gates must not block valid ONEX patterns

# Acceptance Criteria
acceptance_criteria:
  - [ ] Ruff runs without errors on existing codebase
  - [ ] MyPy validates types with protocol support enabled
  - [ ] Black formatting preserves ONEX naming conventions
  - [ ] Pre-commit hooks catch issues before commit
  - [ ] Quality check integration works in VS Code/IDEs
  - [ ] CI/CD integration ready for quality gate enforcement

# Definition of Done
definition_of_done:
  - [ ] All quality tools run successfully on current codebase
  - [ ] Tool configurations are optimized for ONEX patterns
  - [ ] Pre-commit hooks are installed and functional
  - [ ] Makefile includes quality check targets
  - [ ] Documentation includes quality standards
  - [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipeline configured

# ONEX Compliance
onex_compliance:
  standards_checklist:
    - [ ] No `Any` types used (mypy configuration to catch violations)
    - [ ] Proper OnexError usage (ruff rules for error handling)
    - [ ] Contract-driven architecture (mypy protocol validation)
    - [ ] Registry pattern compliance (linting for pattern violations)
    - [ ] Duck typing protocols (mypy configuration for protocol support)
    - [ ] ONEX naming conventions (enforce with ruff and custom rules)
    - [ ] Quality gates implemented (comprehensive tool integration)
    - [ ] No AI attribution in commits (custom ruff rule if needed)
  compliance_notes: "Quality tools must enforce ONEX standards without blocking valid patterns"

# Technical Implementation
implementation_plan:
  - step: "Audit current ruff configuration"
    details: "Run ruff on codebase, analyze and fix configuration issues"
  - step: "Configure mypy for protocol support"
    details: "Enable strict mode with proper protocol type checking"
  - step: "Optimize black configuration"
    details: "Ensure formatting preserves ONEX conventions"
  - step: "Create pre-commit configuration"
    details: "Set up automated hooks for all quality tools"
  - step: "Create quality gate scripts"
    details: "Automate quality checks for CI/CD integration"

# Risk Assessment
risks:
  - risk: "MyPy false positives with protocol patterns"
    probability: "medium"
    impact: "medium"
    mitigation: "Configure mypy exclusions and protocol-specific settings"
  - risk: "Ruff rules conflicting with ONEX patterns"
    probability: "medium"
    impact: "medium"
    mitigation: "Customize ruff configuration, disable problematic rules"
  - risk: "Quality tools performance issues"
    probability: "low"
    impact: "low"
    mitigation: "Profile and optimize tool configurations"

# Success Metrics
success_metrics:
  - metric: "Code quality tool success rate"
    target: "100% pass rate on existing codebase"
    measurement: "Tool execution results"
  - metric: "Quality check execution time"
    target: "<30 seconds for full quality suite"
    measurement: "Timed execution of all tools"
  - metric: "ONEX compliance detection"
    target: "100% detection of major ONEX violations"
    measurement: "Test with intentional violations"

# Notes
notes: |
  Quality tools must balance strict standards with ONEX pattern flexibility.
  Special attention needed for protocol-based patterns and duck typing
  which may confuse traditional static analysis tools.
