title: "Validate and Fix Import Resolution Issues"
epic: "EPIC-001-core-framework-stabilization"
phase: "Phase 1 - Core Functionality"
type: "validation"
priority: "high"
status: "backlog"
complexity: "medium"
estimated_hours: 6

# Problem Statement
problem_statement: |
  With 48/49 __init__.py files present and complex nested package structure, potential
  import resolution issues may exist. Need comprehensive validation of all imports
  across the omnibase package to ensure clean module resolution and prevent runtime errors.

# Business Impact
business_impact:
  severity: "high"
  scope: "development"
  description: "Import issues prevent basic functionality and block all downstream development"

# Requirements
functional_requirements:
  - Comprehensive import validation across all omnibase modules
  - Fix any circular import dependencies
  - Ensure clean import paths for all public APIs
  - Validate imports work in different Python environments
  - Test package installation and import scenarios

non_functional_requirements:
  - Import resolution must be fast and predictable
  - No circular dependencies between modules
  - Clean separation between public and private imports
  - Compatible with Python 3.11+ type checking

# Acceptance Criteria
acceptance_criteria:
  - [ ] All modules can be imported without errors
  - [ ] No circular import dependencies exist
  - [ ] Infrastructure service bases import cleanly
  - [ ] Example node implementations import correctly  
  - [ ] Package works with `from omnibase import *` pattern
  - [ ] MyPy static analysis passes for all imports

# Definition of Done
definition_of_done:
  - [ ] Import validation script passes 100%
  - [ ] All example nodes can be instantiated
  - [ ] MyPy import analysis passes
  - [ ] Ruff import linting passes
  - [ ] Package can be imported in fresh Python environment
  - [ ] Documentation updated with import examples

# ONEX Compliance
onex_compliance:
  standards_checklist:
    - [ ] No `Any` types used (validate import type annotations)
    - [ ] Proper OnexError usage (ensure error imports work)
    - [ ] Contract-driven architecture (validate protocol imports)
    - [ ] Registry pattern compliance (validate container imports)
    - [ ] Duck typing protocols (validate protocol module imports)
    - [ ] ONEX naming conventions (validate import paths)
    - [ ] Quality gates implemented (import validation testing)
    - [ ] No AI attribution in commits

# Notes
notes: |
  This is foundational work that must complete successfully before any
  development environment setup or testing can proceed. Import issues
  will block all other development activities.
