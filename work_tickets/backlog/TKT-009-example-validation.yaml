# Problem Statement
problem_statement: |
  Example node implementations in examples/ directory demonstrate ONEX architecture
  patterns but need validation to ensure they work correctly, follow best practices,
  and serve as reliable canonical examples for ONEX tool development.

# Business Impact
business_impact:
  severity: "high"
  scope: "documentation"
  description: "Example implementations serve as authoritative patterns for all ONEX tool development"

# Requirements
functional_requirements:
  - Validate all 4 example node implementations execute correctly
  - Ensure examples demonstrate proper ONEX architecture patterns
  - Test example integrations with ONEXContainer and protocols
  - Validate contract definitions match implementation patterns
  - Create comprehensive documentation of canonical patterns
  - Test example implementations with realistic data scenarios

non_functional_requirements:
  - Examples must be maintainable and well-documented
  - Performance must be acceptable for demonstration purposes
  - Code quality must meet ONEX standards for reference material
  - Examples must be portable across different environments

# Acceptance Criteria

  - [ ] tool_infrastructure_orchestrator validates and executes correctly
  - [ ] All contract definitions are valid and complete
  - [ ] Examples demonstrate proper error handling patterns
  - [ ] Integration tests validate example workflow functionality
  - [ ] Documentation captures canonical patterns from examples

# Definition of Done

# ONEX Compliance
onex_compliance:
  standards_checklist:
    - [ ] No `Any` types used (validate examples use proper typing)
    - [ ] Proper OnexError usage (validate example error handling)
    - [ ] Contract-driven architecture (validate contract compliance)
    - [ ] Registry pattern compliance (validate DI usage patterns)
    - [ ] Duck typing protocols (validate protocol implementation)
    - [ ] ONEX naming conventions (validate example naming patterns)
    - [ ] Quality gates implemented (comprehensive example validation)
    - [ ] No AI attribution in commits

# Notes
notes: |
  Example implementations are critical reference material for the ONEX
  ecosystem. They must demonstrate perfect ONEX patterns and serve as
  authoritative guides for tool development. Any issues found must be
  fixed to maintain the integrity of ONEX architectural guidance.
