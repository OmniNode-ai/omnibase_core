# Problem Statement
problem_statement: |
  Development environment setup requires proper virtual environment creation, Poetry
  dependency installation, and validation that omnibase-spi integration works correctly.
  Current setup may have dependency conflicts or missing development tools.

# Business Impact
business_impact:
  severity: "medium"
  scope: "development"
  description: "Proper development environment is required for all developers to contribute effectively"

# Requirements
functional_requirements:
  - Create and document virtual environment setup process
  - Validate Poetry dependency resolution works correctly
  - Ensure omnibase-spi v0.0.2 integrates properly via git dependency
  - Install and configure all development dependencies
  - Create development setup validation script

non_functional_requirements:
  - Setup process must be reproducible across different machines
  - Dependencies must resolve without conflicts
  - Development tools must work correctly with project structure
  - Setup should complete in reasonable time (<10 minutes)

# Acceptance Criteria
acceptance_criteria:
  - [ ] Poetry install completes successfully without conflicts
  - [ ] omnibase-spi v0.0.2 is accessible via git dependency
  - [ ] All development dependencies are installed and functional
  - [ ] Virtual environment isolates project dependencies properly
  - [ ] Setup validation script confirms environment is ready
  - [ ] Documentation includes clear setup instructions

# Definition of Done
definition_of_done:
  - [ ] Poetry install works on fresh clone
  - [ ] All imports from omnibase-spi work correctly
  - [ ] Development tools (ruff, mypy, black, pytest) are functional
  - [ ] Setup validation script passes all checks
  - [ ] README.md updated with setup instructions
  - [ ] Makefile includes setup targets

# ONEX Compliance
onex_compliance:
  standards_checklist:
    - [ ] No `Any` types used (N/A - environment setup)
    - [ ] Proper OnexError usage (N/A)
    - [ ] Contract-driven architecture (validate omnibase-spi integration)
    - [ ] Registry pattern compliance (N/A)
    - [ ] Duck typing protocols (validate protocol imports work)
    - [ ] ONEX naming conventions (setup script naming)
    - [ ] Quality gates implemented (setup validation)
    - [ ] No AI attribution in commits

# Technical Implementation
implementation_plan:
  - step: "Validate current pyproject.toml configuration"
    details: "Ensure Poetry configuration is correct for ONEX patterns"
  - step: "Test fresh Poetry install process"
    details: "Install on clean environment, document any issues"
  - step: "Verify omnibase-spi git dependency resolution"
    details: "Confirm v0.0.2 tag can be fetched and installed"
  - step: "Create development setup validation script"
    details: "Automate checks for proper environment configuration"
  - step: "Update documentation and Makefile"
    details: "Provide clear setup instructions and automation"

# Risk Assessment
risks:
  - risk: "Git dependency authentication issues"
    probability: "medium"
    impact: "high"
    mitigation: "Test with different authentication methods, provide alternatives"
  - risk: "Poetry version compatibility issues"
    probability: "low"
    impact: "medium"
    mitigation: "Specify minimum Poetry version requirements"
  - risk: "Dependency version conflicts"
    probability: "medium"
    impact: "medium"
    mitigation: "Use flexible version constraints, test resolution"

# Success Metrics
success_metrics:
  - metric: "Setup success rate"
    target: "100% successful setup on fresh environment"
    measurement: "Setup validation script results"
  - metric: "Dependency resolution time"
    target: "<5 minutes for complete setup"
    measurement: "Timed setup process"
  - metric: "omnibase-spi integration success"
    target: "100% import success from omnibase-spi"
    measurement: "Import validation tests"

# Notes
notes: |
  This setup must work reliably across different developer machines and
  CI environments. The git dependency for omnibase-spi requires special
  attention for authentication and version resolution.
