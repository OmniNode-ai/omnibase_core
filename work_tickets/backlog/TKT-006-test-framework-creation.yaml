title: "Create Comprehensive Test Framework for Base Classes and DI Container"
epic: "EPIC-001-core-framework-stabilization"

# Problem Statement
problem_statement: |
  Basic test structure exists but comprehensive test framework is needed to validate
  all base classes, ONEXContainer functionality, and node implementations. Current
  tests are incomplete and don't cover critical ONEX patterns and error scenarios.

# Business Impact
business_impact:
  severity: "high"
  scope: "quality"
  description: "Comprehensive testing is critical for framework reliability and prevents regressions"

# Requirements
functional_requirements:
  - Create comprehensive test suite for ONEXContainer DI functionality
  - Test all node base classes (Effect, Compute, Reducer, Orchestrator)
  - Validate protocol-based service resolution patterns
  - Test error handling and OnexError propagation
  - Create test utilities and fixtures for ONEX development
  - Implement integration tests for example node implementations

non_functional_requirements:
  - Tests must run quickly (<30 seconds for unit tests)
  - Test coverage must be >90% for core components
  - Tests must be maintainable and well-documented
  - Integration tests must validate real ONEX workflows

# Acceptance Criteria
acceptance_criteria:
  - [ ] ONEXContainer has comprehensive unit tests covering all functionality
  - [ ] All node base classes have thorough test coverage
  - [ ] Protocol-based DI patterns are tested with realistic scenarios
  - [ ] Error handling tests validate proper OnexError usage
  - [ ] Example node implementations have integration tests
  - [ ] Test utilities support ONEX development patterns
  - [ ] Pytest configuration optimized for async testing

# Definition of Done
definition_of_done:
  - [ ] Test suite achieves >90% coverage on core components
  - [ ] All tests pass consistently in CI environment
  - [ ] Test documentation explains ONEX testing patterns
  - [ ] Fixtures and utilities support common test scenarios
  - [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end workflows
  - [ ] Performance tests ensure acceptable framework overhead

# ONEX Compliance
onex_compliance:
  standards_checklist:
    - [ ] No `Any` types used (test type annotations must be specific)
    - [ ] Proper OnexError usage (test error handling patterns)
    - [ ] Contract-driven architecture (test protocol compliance)
    - [ ] Registry pattern compliance (test DI container patterns)
    - [ ] Duck typing protocols (test protocol-based resolution)
    - [ ] ONEX naming conventions (test file and function naming)
    - [ ] Quality gates implemented (comprehensive test coverage)
    - [ ] No AI attribution in commits

# Notes
notes: |
  This is the foundation for all future testing in the ONEX ecosystem.
  Test framework must support both current needs and extensibility for
  future ONEX tool development. Special focus on async patterns and
  protocol-based testing utilities.
