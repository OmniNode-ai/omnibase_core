## Dependency Structure Analysis

### Critical Path (Sequential Dependencies)
```
TKT-001 → TKT-002 → TKT-003 → TKT-004 → TKT-005 → TKT-006 → TKT-008 → TKT-009 → TKT-010
```

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- **TKT-007** (Git validation) can run parallel to Phase 1-2 tickets
- **TKT-010** preparation can start during **TKT-008** execution

### Blocking Relationships
**High-Impact Blockers:**
- TKT-001 blocks TKT-002, TKT-003 (foundational)
- TKT-003 blocks TKT-004 (development environment)
- TKT-006 blocks TKT-008, TKT-009 (testing framework)

## ONEX Compliance Validation

### Standards Compliance Summary
All tickets include comprehensive ONEX compliance checklists covering:

✅ **Zero `Any` Types**: All tickets validate against `Any` type usage  
✅ **OnexError Usage**: Proper error handling patterns enforced  
✅ **Contract-Driven Architecture**: Protocol compliance validated  
✅ **Registry Pattern**: DI container patterns validated  
✅ **Duck Typing Protocols**: Protocol-based resolution enforced  
✅ **Naming Conventions**: ONEX naming standards applied  
✅ **Quality Gates**: Comprehensive validation implemented  
✅ **No AI Attribution**: Commit compliance enforced  

### Compliance Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: TKT-001, TKT-007 (infrastructure only)
- **Medium Risk**: TKT-004, TKT-005, TKT-010 (development tools)
- **High Risk**: TKT-002, TKT-003, TKT-006, TKT-008, TKT-009 (core architecture)

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Tickets (Requiring Senior Developer)
1. **TKT-003** (Import Resolution): Complex module dependencies
2. **TKT-006** (Test Framework): Async testing architecture  
3. **TKT-008** (Node Base Testing): Integration testing complexity
4. **TKT-009** (Example Validation): Architecture pattern validation

### Medium-Risk Tickets
1. **TKT-002** (Container Validation): Already appears clean
2. **TKT-004** (Dev Environment): Git dependency authentication
3. **TKT-005** (Quality Tools): Protocol pattern compatibility

### Low-Risk Tickets
1. **TKT-001** (Package Structure): Simple file creation
2. **TKT-007** (Git Validation): Repository already initialized
3. **TKT-010** (Documentation): Dependent on successful validation

## Success Metrics and Quality Gates

### Epic Success Criteria Coverage
