# EPIC-001: Core Framework Stabilization

## Overview
Complete the foundational setup and stabilization of the omnibase-core framework to provide a clean, production-ready base for ONEX tool development.

## Objectives
- Strip legacy dependencies and cleanup technical debt
- Establish proper Python packaging and development environment  
- Implement comprehensive testing framework
- Validate example implementations and architectural patterns

## Success Criteria
- [ ] ONEXContainer uses pure protocol-based resolution (no legacy registries)
- [ ] Complete package structure with proper __init__.py files
- [ ] Python packaging configured with pyproject.toml (Poetry-based)
- [ ] Git repository properly initialized with clean history
- [ ] Development environment setup with all dependencies
- [ ] Test framework validates all base classes and DI container
- [ ] Code quality tools configured (ruff, mypy, black)
- [ ] Example node implementations validated and tested

## Architectural Impact
This epic addresses the core infrastructure needed for:
- **Protocol-Driven DI**: Clean container.get_service("ProtocolName") pattern
- **4-Node Architecture**: EFFECT → COMPUTE → REDUCER → ORCHESTRATOR workflow
- **Zero Boilerplate**: Eliminate 80+ lines of initialization code per tool
- **Type Safety**: Full protocol-based type checking

## Dependencies
- ✅ omnibase-spi v0.0.2 integration (completed)
- ✅ Poetry configuration and git dependency resolution (completed)
- ✅ Work ticket directory structure (completed)

## Timeline
Target completion: Current sprint (feature/core-stabilization branch)

## Related Work
- Links to individual tickets will be added as they are created
- Integration with omnibase-spi protocol definitions
- Foundation for future tool development across ONEX ecosystem
