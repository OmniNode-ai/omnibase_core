**Serialization Performance** (1000 iterations):
```
Operation                    Avg Time    Ops/sec     Status
JSON Serialization         0.002ms     473,059     ✅ Excellent
JSON Deserialization       0.002ms     565,756     ✅ Excellent
Property Caching           86.7% faster            ✅ Major improvement
LRU Caching               -31.7% overhead          ⚠️ Review needed
```

**Key Findings**:
- Property caching optimizations deliver significant performance gains
- LRU caching shows unexpected overhead - investigate further
- Basic operations maintain excellent performance characteristics

### 2. Validation Hook Performance ✅

**Execution Times** (5 iterations each):
```
Script                           Avg Time    Success Rate    Status
validate-elif-limit.py          0.035s      100%           ✅ Working
validate-onex-error-compliance  0.025s      0%             ❌ Failing
validate-stubbed-functionality  0.026s      0%             ❌ Failing
```

**Key Findings**:
- All validation hooks execute very quickly (< 0.04s)
- Total validation time: 0.087s - well within acceptable limits
- Two hooks failing likely due to detecting actual compliance issues
- Scaling analysis shows ~14,000+ files/second processing rate

**Recommendations**:
- ✅ Performance is excellent - no optimizations needed
- 🔧 Fix failing validation hooks (likely compliance issues, not performance)
- 📈 Consider parallel execution for large codebases (1000+ files)

### 3. Import Performance Analysis ❌

**Critical Issue Detected**: Circular import dependencies
```
Circular Import Patterns (3 detected):
1. omnibase_core.exceptions.onex_error ↔ model_error_context ↔ model_numeric_value
2. model_error_context ↔ model_schema_value ↔ model_numeric_value
3. model_schema_value ↔ model_numeric_value
```

**Import Analysis Results**:
- 369 Python files analyzed in 0.25s
- 692 potentially unused imports detected
- All modified module imports failing due to circular dependencies
- Import failures prevent performance testing of modified files

**Critical Actions Required**:
1. 🚨 **HIGH PRIORITY**: Resolve circular import dependencies
2. 🧹 **MEDIUM**: Clean up 692 unused imports
3. 📋 **LOW**: Improve import organization (51 files)

### 4. Memory Usage Analysis ✅

**Memory Consumption**:
```
Metric                      Value       Status
Initial Memory             14.7MB       Baseline
Final Memory               15.0MB       After testing
Net Growth                 0.3MB        ✅ Minimal
Property Caching Impact    ~0MB         ✅ Negligible
LRU Cache Impact           0.16MB       ✅ Acceptable
```

**Key Findings**:
- Memory usage is well-controlled across all tests
- Property caching has negligible memory overhead
- LRU caching adds acceptable 0.16MB overhead
- No memory leak patterns detected
