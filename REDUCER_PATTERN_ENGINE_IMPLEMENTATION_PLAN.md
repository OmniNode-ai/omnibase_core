# Reducer Pattern Engine - Comprehensive Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for the Reducer Pattern Engine, a core architectural component for multi-workflow execution in the omnibase-core system. Based on Archon ticket ccf4203c-639c-49a9-8e11-46cf136461a2, this plan addresses the key requirements for workflow routing, subreducer frameworks, instance isolation, and integration with the existing ONEX 4-node architecture.

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Core Components

The Reducer Pattern Engine consists of the following primary components:

```
ReducerPatternEngine
├── WorkflowRouter                     # Top-level routing by {workflowType, instanceId}
├── SubreducerFramework               # FSM logic delegation framework
├── InstanceIsolationManager          # Workflow instance isolation
├── ReducerRegistry                   # Subreducer registration and discovery
├── WorkflowStateManager             # State management across workflows
└── IntegrationBridge                # ONEX architecture integration
```

### 1.2 Key Design Principles

Based on analysis of existing NodeReducer and NodeOrchestrator implementations:

- **Pure Functional Programming**: Deterministic behavior through immutable state patterns
- **Async/Await Consistency**: Following established ONEX async patterns
- **ONEX Protocol Compliance**: Integration with existing protocol_reducer.py patterns
- **Canary System Integration**: Compatible with existing canary deployment infrastructure
- **Performance Optimization**: Built-in metrics, circuit breakers, and error handling

### 1.3 Integration Points

The system integrates with existing ONEX components:

- **NodeReducer**: Extends core reduction capabilities for workflow-specific logic
- **NodeOrchestrator**: Coordinates with workflow orchestration patterns
- **Canary System**: Leverages existing canary deployment and monitoring
- **Event System**: Uses existing event bus and messaging patterns
- **Container System**: Follows ONEXContainer dependency injection patterns

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Workflow Routing Architecture

```python
class WorkflowRouter:
    """Top-level router for workflow instances by type and ID."""
    
    def route_workflow(
        self,
        workflow_type: EnumWorkflowType,
        instance_id: str,
        workflow_data: dict[str, Any]
    ) -> ReducerInstance:
        """Route workflow to appropriate subreducer instance."""
```

**Key Features:**
- Hash-based routing for consistent instance assignment
- Load balancing across available subreducer instances
- Circuit breaker protection for failed routes
- Metrics collection for routing performance

### 2.2 Subreducer Framework

```python
class SubreducerFramework:
    """Framework for FSM logic delegation to specialized reducers."""
    
    async def delegate_to_subreducer(
        self,
        workflow_type: EnumWorkflowType,
        state_data: WorkflowStateData,
        fsm_context: FSMContext
    ) -> ReducerResult:
        """Delegate workflow processing to appropriate subreducer."""
```

**FSM Integration:**
- State machine definitions from existing contract patterns
- Transition validation using Pydantic models
- State persistence across workflow steps
- Error recovery and rollback capabilities

### 2.3 Instance Isolation Manager

```python
class InstanceIsolationManager:
    """Ensures workflow instances don't interfere with each other."""
    
    def create_isolated_context(
        self,
        instance_id: str,
        workflow_type: EnumWorkflowType
    ) -> IsolationContext:
        """Create isolated execution context for workflow instance."""
```

**Isolation Features:**
- Memory isolation using separate contexts
- Resource quotas per workflow instance
- Timeout enforcement and cleanup
- State isolation with correlation IDs

## 4. Key Implementation Details

### 4.1 Workflow Routing Logic

The routing system uses consistent hashing to ensure workflow instances are always routed to the same subreducer:

```python
def calculate_route_key(self, workflow_type: EnumWorkflowType, instance_id: str) -> str:
    """Calculate consistent routing key for workflow instance."""
    combined_key = f"{workflow_type.value}:{instance_id}"
    return hashlib.sha256(combined_key.encode()).hexdigest()[:16]

async def route_to_subreducer(self, route_key: str) -> SubreducerInstance:
    """Route to appropriate subreducer with load balancing."""
    available_instances = await self.get_available_instances(workflow_type)
    if not available_instances:
        raise NoAvailableSubreducersError()
    
    # Use consistent hashing for routing
    selected_instance = self.consistent_hash_selector.select(
        route_key, available_instances
    )
    return selected_instance
```

### 4.2 Instance Isolation Implementation

Each workflow instance runs in an isolated context:

```python
class IsolationContext:
    """Isolated execution context for workflow instances."""
    
    def __init__(self, instance_id: str, workflow_type: EnumWorkflowType):
        self.instance_id = instance_id
        self.workflow_type = workflow_type
        self.correlation_id = str(uuid4())
        self.resource_limits = ResourceLimits.for_workflow_type(workflow_type)
        self.state_store = IsolatedStateStore(instance_id)
        self.metrics_collector = MetricsCollector(instance_id)
        
    async def __aenter__(self):
        await self.acquire_resources()
        return self
        
    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        await self.cleanup_resources()
```

### 4.3 FSM Logic Delegation

The subreducer framework uses finite state machines for workflow logic:

```python
class SubreducerFramework:
    async def execute_workflow_step(
        self,
        current_state: WorkflowState,
        input_data: dict[str, Any],
        fsm_definition: FSMDefinition
    ) -> WorkflowStepResult:
        """Execute single workflow step using FSM logic."""
        
        # Validate current state transition
        next_state = fsm_definition.get_next_state(
            current_state.status, 
            input_data
        )
        
        if not next_state:
            raise InvalidStateTransitionError()
        
        # Execute subreducer logic for this transition
        subreducer = self.get_subreducer(current_state.workflow_type)
        result = await subreducer.process_transition(
            current_state, next_state, input_data
        )
        
        return WorkflowStepResult(
            previous_state=current_state.status,
            new_state=next_state,
            result_data=result,
            execution_time_ms=result.execution_time_ms
        )
```

### 4.4 Integration with Existing Systems

The engine integrates with existing ONEX components:

```python
class NodeReducerPatternEngine(NodeReducerService):
    """ONEX node implementation of Reducer Pattern Engine."""
    
    def __init__(self, container: ONEXContainer):
        super().__init__(container)
        
        # Initialize core components
        self.workflow_router = WorkflowRouter(container)
        self.subreducer_framework = SubreducerFramework(container)
        self.instance_manager = InstanceIsolationManager(container)
        
        # Load contract and configuration
        self.contract_model = self._load_contract_model()
        
        # Initialize monitoring (following canary patterns)
        self.metrics_collector = get_metrics_collector("reducer_pattern_engine")
        self.circuit_breaker = get_circuit_breaker("workflow_routing", config)
        
    async def reduce(
        self, 
        reducer_input: ModelReducerInput
    ) -> ModelReducerOutput:
        """Main reduction entry point for workflow processing."""
        
        # Parse workflow routing information
        workflow_data = WorkflowRoutingData.model_validate(reducer_input.data)
        
        # Route to appropriate workflow handler
        with self.instance_manager.create_isolated_context(
            workflow_data.instance_id, 
            workflow_data.workflow_type
        ) as context:
            
            result = await self.subreducer_framework.process_workflow(
                workflow_data, context
            )
            
            return ModelReducerOutput(
                data=result.model_dump(),
                metadata={
                    "workflow_type": workflow_data.workflow_type.value,
                    "instance_id": workflow_data.instance_id,
                    "execution_time_ms": result.execution_time_ms
                }
            )
```
