## Architectural Pattern Knowledge

### Universal Mixin Design Strategy

**Core Principle**: Create mixins that provide cross-cutting capabilities universally applicable across all node types rather than node-specific implementations.

**Implementation Pattern**:
```yaml
# Universal applicability configuration
type: core_mixin
compatibility:
  node_types: ["COMPUTE", "EFFECT", "REDUCER", "ORCHESTRATOR"]
  onex_version: ">=1.0.0"

# Capability-based architecture
capabilities:
  secure_error_handling:
    provides: [sensitive_data_filtering, secure_error_messages, correlation_id_validation]
  circuit_breaker_management:
    provides: [configurable_failure_thresholds, automatic_recovery, graceful_degradation]
  metrics_collection:
    provides: [operation_timing, error_rate_tracking, success_metrics]
  configuration_management:
    provides: [type_safe_config, environment_variables, runtime_validation]
```

**Why This Works**:
- Single source of truth for cross-cutting concerns
- Eliminates code duplication across 4 node types
- Provides consistent behavior and interfaces
- Enables centralized maintenance and updates
- Follows ONEX framework conventions

### Type Safety Implementation Pattern

**Strategy**: Complete Pydantic model backing with comprehensive validation for all action inputs, outputs, and configuration sections.

**Implementation Components**:

1. **Action Input Models** with validation:
```python
class HandleErrorInput(BaseModel):
    error: Exception = Field(..., description="Exception instance to handle")
    context: Dict[str, Any] = Field(..., description="Operation context (will be sanitized)")
    correlation_id: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Request correlation ID for tracing")
    operation_name: str = Field(..., description="Name of the operation that failed")

    @field_validator("correlation_id")
    @classmethod
    def validate_correlation_id(cls, v: Optional[str]) -> Optional[str]:
        if v is not None and (len(v) < 8 or len(v) > 128):
            raise ValueError("correlation_id must be between 8-128 characters")
        return v
```

2. **Configuration Models** with defaults and constraints:
```python
class ErrorHandlingConfig(BaseModel):
    sanitize_production_errors: bool = Field(True, description="Enable sensitive data sanitization")
    max_context_fields: int = Field(20, ge=1, description="Maximum context fields to include")
    correlation_id_required: bool = Field(False, description="Whether correlation ID is required")
```

3. **Enum-Based State Management**:
```python
class CircuitBreakerState(str, Enum):
    CLOSED = "CLOSED"
    OPEN = "OPEN"
    HALF_OPEN = "HALF_OPEN"
```

**Benefits Achieved**:
- Complete runtime validation of all inputs/outputs
- Clear API contracts with type hints
- Automatic documentation generation
- Prevention of runtime type errors
- Enhanced IDE support and autocomplete

### Security-First Design Pattern

**Core Principle**: Production-ready security with information disclosure prevention built into the architecture.

**Security Implementation Features**:

1. **Sensitive Data Sanitization**:
```yaml
capabilities:
  secure_error_handling:
    provides:
      - sensitive_data_filtering    # Remove sensitive data from error contexts
      - secure_error_messages      # Generate safe error messages
      - correlation_id_validation  # Validate tracking identifiers
      - operation_context_management # Manage context safely
```

2. **Configuration-Driven Security**:
```yaml
configuration:
  error_handling:
    sanitize_production_errors:
      type: boolean
      default: true
      description: "Enable sensitive data sanitization in production"
```

3. **Safe Error Handling Pattern**:
```python
class HandleErrorOutput(BaseModel):
    message: str = Field(..., description="Safe error message without sensitive information")
    safe_context: Dict[str, Any] = Field(..., description="Sanitized context safe for logging")
    error_id: str = Field(..., description="Unique identifier for error tracking")
    correlation_id: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Request correlation ID")
```

**Security Benefits**:
- Prevents information disclosure in production
- Maintains correlation IDs for tracing without exposing sensitive data
- Configurable sanitization levels
- Safe error message generation

### Integration Pattern with ONEX Framework

**Strategy**: Follow established ONEX conventions while providing base functionality that other mixins can depend on.

**Integration Design**:

1. **Initialization Priority**:
```yaml
integration:
  initialization_order: 1        # Initialize early as base functionality
  cleanup_order: 99             # Cleanup late to support other mixins
  required_for_health_check: true
  provides_base_functionality: true
```

2. **Dependency Declaration**:
```yaml
dependencies:
  python_packages:
    - pydantic: ">=2.0.0"
    - asyncio: ">=3.4.0"
  internal_modules:
    - omnibase_core.core.onex_error
    - omnibase_core.enums.enum_health_status
```

3. **Metrics Integration**:
```yaml
metrics:
  provided:
    - error_handling.operations_total
    - error_handling.errors_total
    - error_handling.success_rate
    - circuit_breaker.state_changes
  labels:
    - operation_name
    - node_type
    - error_type
```

**Integration Benefits**:
- Seamless integration with existing ONEX infrastructure
- Proper initialization and cleanup lifecycle
- Standard metrics and observability
- Compatible with contract validation system

## Reusable Patterns for Future Development

### Cross-Cutting Concern Mixin Pattern

**When to Use**: Any capability needed by multiple node types (logging, authentication, caching, monitoring, etc.)

**Implementation Template**:
```yaml
# 1. Universal compatibility
type: core_mixin
compatibility:
  node_types: ["COMPUTE", "EFFECT", "REDUCER", "ORCHESTRATOR"]

# 2. Capability-based design  
capabilities:
  primary_capability:
    provides: [specific_features]

# 3. Comprehensive actions with type safety
actions:
  primary_action:
    input_schema: {complete_validation}
    output_schema: {complete_validation}

# 4. Environment-based configuration
configuration:
  capability_config:
    setting: {type, default, description}
```

### Type Safety Implementation Pattern

**Pydantic Model Organization**:
```python
# 1. Enums for state management
class StateEnum(str, Enum):
    VALUE1 = "value1"

# 2. Input models with validation
class ActionInput(BaseModel):
    field: Type = Field(..., description="Clear description")

    @field_validator("field")
    @classmethod
    def validate_field(cls, v): # Custom validation logic

# 3. Output models with constraints
class ActionOutput(BaseModel):
    result: Type = Field(..., ge=0, description="Constrained result")

# 4. Configuration models with defaults
class CapabilityConfig(BaseModel):
    setting: Type = Field(default_value, description="Configuration setting")
```
