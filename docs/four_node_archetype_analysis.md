# Four Node Archetype Pattern Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis examines the four node archetype pattern implemented in the ONEX architecture. The pattern demonstrates excellent alignment with modern software architecture principles, providing a robust foundation for scalable, maintainable systems through clear separation of concerns and contract-driven development.

## Architecture Overview

### Pattern Definition
The ONEX Four-Node Architecture organizes system functionality into four specialized node types:
