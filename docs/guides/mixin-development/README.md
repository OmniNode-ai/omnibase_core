# Mixin Development Guide

**Status**: Active
**Target Audience**: Developers creating reusable ONEX mixins
**Prerequisites**: Understanding of ONEX node types, YAML, Pydantic
**Related**: [Mixin Architecture](../../architecture/MIXIN_ARCHITECTURE.md), [Node Building Guide](../node-building/README.md)

## Overview

This comprehensive guide teaches you how to create production-ready mixins (subcontracts) for the ONEX framework. Mixins provide reusable cross-cutting concerns that can be composed into nodes while maintaining architectural boundaries.

## What You'll Learn

- **Mixin Fundamentals**: Understanding the three-layer mixin architecture
- **YAML Schema**: Complete reference for mixin contract structure
- **Pydantic Models**: Creating strongly-typed backing models
- **Integration**: Connecting mixins to nodes
- **Best Practices**: Patterns, tools, and validation strategies

2. Add auth configuration (token URL, credentials)
3. Restrict to EFFECT nodes only
4. Create Pydantic model with validation

**See**: [Node Type Constraints](../../architecture/MIXIN_ARCHITECTURE.md#node-type-constraints)

### Creating a Caching Mixin

**Goal**: Add caching to REDUCER nodes

2. Add cache configuration (TTL, size, eviction policy)
3. Restrict to REDUCER nodes only
4. Implement cache invalidation actions

**See**: [Pydantic Models](03_PYDANTIC_MODELS.md) for validation patterns

## Validation and Testing

### Contract Validation

```bash
# Validate mixin contract
poetry run onex run contract_validator --contract src/your_project/mixins/mixin_your_feature.yaml

# Validate complete node contract (with mixins)
poetry run onex run contract_validator --contract src/your_project/nodes/your_node/v1_0_0/contract.yaml
```

### Testing Mixins

```python
# Test mixin Pydantic model
import pytest
from your_project.model.subcontracts import ModelYourFeatureSubcontract

def test_mixin_validation():
    """Test mixin model validation."""
    mixin = ModelYourFeatureSubcontract(
        feature_enabled=True,
        timeout_ms=5000
    )
    assert mixin.feature_enabled is True
    assert mixin.timeout_ms == 5000
```
