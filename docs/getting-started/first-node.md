# Your First Node - omnibase_core

**Status**: ðŸš§ Coming Soon
**Estimated Time**: 20 minutes

## Overview

This tutorial guides you through creating your first complete ONEX node from scratch, with testing and deployment.

## What You'll Build

A temperature converter COMPUTE node that:
- Converts between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- Validates input ranges
- Handles errors gracefully
- Includes comprehensive tests

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Installation](installation.md)
- Completed [Quick Start](quick-start.md)
- Basic Python knowledge

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Project Setup

```bash
mkdir my-first-node
cd my-first-node
poetry init
poetry add omnibase_core
```

### Step 2: Create Your Node

**Full implementation coming soon...**

### Step 3: Write Tests

**Test examples coming soon...**

### Step 4: Run and Validate

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/
poetry run mypy src/
```
