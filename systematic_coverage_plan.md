# Systematic Coverage Plan to Reach 60%

## Current Status
- **Current Coverage**: 31.34%
- **Target Coverage**: 60.00%
- **Gap to Close**: 28.66%
- **Failing Tests**: 51
- **Warnings**: 93

## Phase 1: Fix Failing Tests (Priority 1)
**Goal**: Get all tests passing before adding new coverage

### High-Impact Failing Tests to Fix First:
1. **Security/Serialization Tests** (8 failures)
   - `test_model_signature_chain.py` - serialization issues
   - `test_field_converter.py` - validation errors

2. **YAML/Contract Loading Tests** (8 failures)
   - `test_safe_yaml_loader_branches.py` - exception handling
   - `test_util_contract_loader_part1.py` - complex contract loading

3. **Validation Tests** (8 failures)
   - `test_contracts_extended.py` - timeout and CLI errors
   - `test_migrator_protocol.py` - validation errors

4. **Other Tests** (27 failures)
   - Various model and utility tests

## Phase 2: Fix Warnings (Priority 2)
**Goal**: Clean up all warnings for better code quality

### Warning Categories:
1. **Pydantic Deprecation Warnings** (already fixed most)
2. **Import Warnings**
3. **Test Configuration Warnings**
4. **Other Deprecation Warnings**

## Phase 3: Target High-Impact Files (Priority 3)
**Goal**: Add tests for files with most uncovered lines

### Strategy: Focus on files with 100+ uncovered lines first

#### Tier 1: Massive Impact Files (200+ uncovered lines)
- Large model files with complex validation
- Core infrastructure files
- Event handling systems

#### Tier 2: High Impact Files (100-200 uncovered lines)
- Medium-sized model files
- Utility functions
- Configuration files

#### Tier 3: Medium Impact Files (50-100 uncovered lines)
- Smaller model files
- Enum files
- Helper functions

#### Tier 4: Low Impact Files (<50 uncovered lines)
- Simple enums
- Small utility functions
- Configuration constants

## Phase 4: Systematic Testing Approach

### 1. Start with 0% Coverage Files
- **Enums**: Already started, continue with remaining
- **Simple Models**: Basic Pydantic models
- **Utilities**: Helper functions

### 2. Target Large Files with Low Coverage
- **Model Files**: Complex Pydantic models
- **Infrastructure**: Core system components
- **Event Systems**: Event handling and routing

### 3. Focus on High-Impact Areas
- **Core Models**: Essential business logic
- **Validation**: Input validation and error handling
- **Serialization**: Data transformation
- **Configuration**: System configuration

## Phase 5: Coverage Optimization

### 1. Identify Files with Most Uncovered Lines
- Sort by uncovered lines (descending)
- Focus on files with 100+ uncovered lines
- Target files with <50% coverage

### 2. Create Test Templates
- **Enum Tests**: Standard enum testing pattern
- **Model Tests**: Pydantic model validation
- **Utility Tests**: Function behavior testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflows

### 3. Batch Testing Strategy
- **Group 1**: 0% coverage files (quick wins)
- **Group 2**: High-impact files (maximum coverage gain)
- **Group 3**: Medium-impact files (steady progress)
- **Group 4**: Low-impact files (completion)

## Expected Impact

### Phase 1 (Fix Tests): +0% coverage, but enables progress
### Phase 2 (Fix Warnings): +0% coverage, but improves quality
### Phase 3 (High-Impact Files): +15-20% coverage
### Phase 4 (Systematic Testing): +10-15% coverage
### Phase 5 (Optimization): +5-10% coverage

**Total Expected Coverage**: 60-70%

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Parallel Execution
- Fix failing tests first (blocking issue)
- Address warnings in parallel
- Add coverage tests in batches

### 2. Incremental Progress
- Target 5% coverage increase per batch
- Focus on highest-impact files first
- Use systematic approach to avoid gaps

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Ensure all tests pass before moving to next phase
- Fix warnings as they appear
- Maintain code quality standards

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix the 51 failing tests
2. **Short-term**: Address the 93 warnings
3. **Medium-term**: Target high-impact files for coverage
4. **Long-term**: Systematic coverage improvement to 60%

This approach should efficiently get us to 60% coverage while maintaining code quality.
