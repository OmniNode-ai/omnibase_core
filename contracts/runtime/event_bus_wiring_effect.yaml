# ONEX Runtime Event Bus Wiring Effect Contract
#
# This contract defines the event_bus_wiring EFFECT node that wires instantiated
# nodes to event bus subscriptions as part of the ONEX runtime self-hosting architecture.
#
# Role in Runtime Lifecycle:

# Node Implementation (NO custom code needed):
#   from omnibase_core.nodes import NodeEffect
#   class NodeEventBusWiringEffect(NodeEffect):
#       pass  # All logic driven by this YAML contract
#
# Features:
# - Wire nodes to event bus subscriptions based on declared topics
# - Support for multiple event bus types (inmemory, kafka, etc.)
# - Retry logic for transient subscription failures
# - Health checks for subscription status
# - Publish runtime.ready event when wiring is complete

    Wires instantiated nodes to event bus subscriptions.
    Receives the node graph from node_graph reducer, subscribes each node
    to its declared topics, and publishes runtime.ready when complete.
