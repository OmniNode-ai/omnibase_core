## ‚ùì NOT YET UNARCHIVED - NEED DECISION (3 mixins)

### 1. ‚≠ê mixin_node_service.py - **UNARCHIVE RECOMMENDED**

**Status**: üü¢ **CRITICAL - UNARCHIVE IMMEDIATELY**

**Why Unarchive**:
- Provides persistent service mode capabilities
- Required for MCP server nodes, GraphQL endpoints, long-lived services
- NOT available in any current mixin

**Capabilities**:
```python
# Service lifecycle
- start_service_mode() / stop_service_mode()
- Async event loop for concurrent operations
- Signal handlers (SIGTERM, SIGINT) for graceful shutdown

# Tool invocation handling
- TOOL_INVOCATION event ‚Üí node.run() ‚Üí TOOL_RESPONSE
- Automatic event-to-input-state conversion
- Result serialization and response publishing

# Monitoring & metrics
- Health monitoring loop (30s intervals)
- Service metrics: uptime, success rate, active invocations
- Performance tracking: total/successful/failed invocations

# Error handling
- Graceful shutdown with active invocation tracking
- Timeout-based invocation waiting
- Comprehensive error response publishing
```

**Archive Locations** (2 copies, slight differences):
- `archived/src/omnibase_core/mixin/mixin_node_service.py` ‚Üê **USE THIS (better type hints)**
- `archived/src/omnibase_core/core/mixins/mixin_node_service.py`

**Differences**:
```python
# mixin/ version (PREFERRED):
def get_service_health(self) -> dict[str, Any]:  # ‚úÖ Correct (returns int, bool, str)
def _serialize_result(self, result: Any) -> dict[str, Any]:  # ‚úÖ Correct

# core/mixins/ version:
def get_service_health(self) -> dict[str, str]:  # ‚ùå Wrong (returns mixed types)
def _serialize_result(self, result: Any) -> dict[str, str]:  # ‚ùå Wrong
```

**Action Required**:
```bash
# Unarchive the better version
cp archived/src/omnibase_core/mixin/mixin_node_service.py \
   src/omnibase_core/mixins/mixin_node_service.py

# Update import (line 40):
# OLD: from omnibase_core.mixin.mixin_event_driven_node import MixinEventDrivenNode
# NEW: from omnibase_core.mixins.mixin_event_driven_node import MixinEventDrivenNode
```

### 2. üóëÔ∏è mixin_generic_introspection.py - **DELETE RECOMMENDED**

**Status**: üî¥ **OBSOLETE - DELETE**

**Why Delete**:
- Completely superseded by current `mixin_introspection.py`
- Archived: 104 lines, basic functionality
- Current: 530 lines, comprehensive functionality

**Feature Comparison**:

| Feature | Archived (generic) | Current (full) |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Lines of code | 104 | 530 |
| Contract generation | ‚ùå Basic | ‚úÖ Full ModelContract |
| State models | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ ModelStates extraction |
| Error codes | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ ModelErrorCodes extraction |
| Dependencies | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ ModelDependencies |
| Event channels | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ ModelEventChannels |
| Performance profile | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ ModelPerformanceProfileInfo |
| CLI interface | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ ModelCLIInterface |
| Version management | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ Full semver support |
| Ecosystem metadata | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ Categories, tags, maturity |

**Archive Location**:
- `archived/src/omnibase_core/core/mixins/mixin_generic_introspection.py`

**Action Required**:
```bash
rm archived/src/omnibase_core/core/mixins/mixin_generic_introspection.py
```

---

### 3. üóëÔ∏è mixin_registry_injection.py - **DELETE RECOMMENDED**

**Status**: üî¥ **OBSOLETE - DELETE**

**Why Delete**:
- Replaced by ModelONEXContainer dependency injection pattern
- Old architecture pattern no longer used

**Pattern Comparison**:

| Aspect | Old (registry) | New (container) |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Mixin | MixinRegistryInjection | Built-in to NodeBase |
| Access pattern | `self.registry.get_service(name)` | `container.get_service(name)` |
| Validation | Protocol-based duck typing | Type-safe protocols |
| Health checks | Registry-level | Container-level |
| Scope | Node-specific registry | Global container |

**Archive Location**:
- `archived/src/omnibase_core/mixin/mixin_registry_injection.py`

**Action Required**:
```bash
rm archived/src/omnibase_core/mixin/mixin_registry_injection.py
```

## üìã EXECUTION PLAN

### Step 1: Unarchive mixin_node_service.py

```bash
# Copy the better version
cp /Volumes/PRO-G40/Code/omnibase_core/archived/src/omnibase_core/mixin/mixin_node_service.py \
   /Volumes/PRO-G40/Code/omnibase_core/src/omnibase_core/mixins/mixin_node_service.py

# Update import on line 40
sed -i '' 's/from omnibase_core.mixin.mixin_event_driven_node/from omnibase_core.mixins.mixin_event_driven_node/' \
   /Volumes/PRO-G40/Code/omnibase_core/src/omnibase_core/mixins/mixin_node_service.py
```

### Step 2: Delete all archived mixins (35 files total)

```bash
cd /Volumes/PRO-G40/Code/omnibase_core/archived

# Delete 29 already-unarchived mixins (33 files including duplicates)
rm src/omnibase_core/mixin/mixin_canonical_serialization.py
rm src/omnibase_core/mixin/mixin_cli_handler.py

rm src/omnibase_core/mixin/mixin_registry_injection.py

# Delete 2 duplicate mixin_node_service.py copies (after unarchiving)
rm src/omnibase_core/core/mixins/mixin_node_service.py
rm src/omnibase_core/mixin/mixin_node_service.py
```

### Step 3: Verify cleanup

```bash
# Should return empty (no more mixin files in archive)
find /Volumes/PRO-G40/Code/omnibase_core/archived -name "mixin*.py" -type f

# Verify mixin_node_service.py exists in current
ls -lh /Volumes/PRO-G40/Code/omnibase_core/src/omnibase_core/mixins/mixin_node_service.py
```
