# Checks that every active OmniNode repo has the architecture-handshake
# CI workflow installed and passing on its default branch.
# Runs weekly and on manual dispatch; requires POLICY_GATE_TOKEN for
# cross-repo visibility (see token note below).

# NOTE: GITHUB_TOKEN is scoped to this repo only. Some OmniNode repos are
# private, so this workflow requires POLICY_GATE_TOKEN (an org-level PAT or
# GitHub App token with actions:read across the org). Without it, private
# repo checks will fail with 404.
