"""Legacy DoD receipt migration utility (OMN-9790).

The OMN-9786 PR added four required fields to ``ModelDodReceipt``:
``verifier``, ``probe_command``, ``probe_stdout``, and ``schema_version``.
Receipts on disk that pre-date that change cannot validate against the new
schema and would silently degrade the receipt-gate to FAIL.

This module rewrites legacy receipts in-place so they validate as ADVISORY
(per the Centralized Transition Policy in :mod:`omnibase_core.models.contracts.ticket.model_dod_receipt`)
while preserving the prior status in an ``original_status`` audit field.

Two entry points are exposed:

* :func:`migrate_receipt_file` — migrate a single receipt path
* :func:`migrate_receipts_in_root` — walk ``drift/dod_receipts/`` and
  ``.evidence/`` under a repo root and migrate every legacy receipt found

Both functions are idempotent: a receipt that already carries a ``verifier``
field is treated as already-migrated and left byte-identical.

The CLI entry point lives in
``omnibase_core/scripts/migrate_dod_receipts.py`` so this module can be
imported without side effects.
