ModelServiceOrchestrator - Standard Production-Ready Orchestrator Node

Pre-composed with essential mixins for production use:
- Persistent service mode (MixinNodeService) - long-lived MCP servers, tool invocation
- Orchestrator semantics (workflow coordination, dependency management)
- Health monitoring (MixinHealthCheck)
- Event publishing (MixinEventBus)
- Performance metrics (MixinMetrics)

This service wrapper eliminates boilerplate by pre-wiring commonly used mixins
for orchestrator nodes that coordinate multi-node workflows and manage dependencies.

Usage Example:
    ```python
    from omnibase_core.models.nodes.services.model_service_orchestrator import ModelServiceOrchestrator
    from omnibase_core.models.container.model_onex_container import ModelONEXContainer
    from omnibase_core.models.contracts.model_contract_orchestrator import ModelContractOrchestrator

    class NodeWorkflowOrchestrator(ModelServiceOrchestrator):
        '''Workflow orchestrator with automatic event coordination and metrics.'''

        async def execute_orchestration(self, contract: ModelContractOrchestrator) -> dict:
            # Emit workflow started event
            await self.publish_event(
                event_type="workflow_started",
                payload={"workflow_id": str(contract.workflow_id)},
                correlation_id=contract.correlation_id
            )

            # Coordinate subnode execution
            results = await self._execute_workflow(contract)

            # Emit workflow completed event
            await self.publish_event(
                event_type="workflow_completed",
                payload={
                    "workflow_id": str(contract.workflow_id),
                    "steps_completed": len(results)
                },
                correlation_id=contract.correlation_id
            )

            return results
    ```

Included Capabilities:
    - Persistent service mode with TOOL_INVOCATION handling (MixinNodeService)
    - Service lifecycle management (start_service_mode, stop_service_mode)
    - Workflow coordination with dependency tracking
    - Subnode health aggregation
    - Event emission for workflow lifecycle via MixinEventBus
    - Performance metrics for workflow execution via MixinMetrics
    - Correlation ID tracking across workflow steps
    - Health check aggregation from managed subnodes

    Standard Orchestrator Node Service.

    Combines NodeOrchestrator base class with essential production mixins:
    - Persistent service mode (MixinNodeService) - run as long-lived tool service
    - Orchestrator semantics (workflow coordination, dependency management)
    - Health monitoring (MixinHealthCheck) - includes subnode health aggregation
    - Event publishing (MixinEventBus) - critical for workflow coordination
    - Performance metrics (MixinMetrics)

    Method Resolution Order (MRO):
        ModelServiceOrchestrator → MixinNodeService → NodeOrchestrator → MixinHealthCheck
        → MixinEventBus → MixinMetrics → NodeCoreBase → ABC

    This composition is optimized for:
    - Multi-step workflow coordination requiring event-driven communication
    - Dependency management across multiple subnodes
    - Workflow lifecycle tracking (started, in-progress, completed, failed)
    - Parallel execution coordination with result aggregation

    Why MixinEventBus is critical:
        Orchestrators emit many events during workflow execution:
        - Workflow lifecycle events (started, completed, failed)
        - Subnode coordination events
        - Progress updates
        - Error notifications

    For custom mixin compositions, inherit directly from NodeOrchestrator
    and add your desired mixins instead.

        Initialize ModelServiceOrchestrator with container dependency injection.

        All mixin initialization is handled automatically via Python's MRO.
        Each mixin's __init__ is called in sequence, setting up:
        - Health check framework (with subnode aggregation support)
        - Event bus connection for workflow coordination
        - Metrics collectors for workflow performance tracking
