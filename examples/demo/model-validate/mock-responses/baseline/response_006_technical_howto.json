Here's how to export your data: 1) Go to Settings > Data Management > Export, 2) Select 'Full Export' to include all projects, 3) Choose your format (CSV or JSON - both are available), 4) Check the 'Include Version History' box, 5) Click 'Generate Export'. The export will be emailed to you within a few minutes depending on data size. Pro tip: JSON format preserves the most metadata and is best for re-importing later!",
