Here's how to fix it: 1) Go to Settings > Display > Text Encoding, 2) Change from 'Auto-detect' to 'UTF-8 (Unicode)', 3) Clear your browser cache and refresh. If you're using the desktop app, please also check that your system language settings include UTF-8 support. Let me know if this resolves the display issues!",
