  Hi Support Team,

  I was charged for a subscription renewal on January 10th, but I had
  cancelled my subscription back in December. Could you please process a refund
  for this charge?

  My account email is user@example.com and the transaction ID is TXN-12345.

  Thank you for your help!

  Best regards,
  Customer
