body: |
  Hello,

  I'm experiencing consistent sync failures between my local client and the
  cloud service. The error occurs approximately every 3rd sync attempt.

  Error Details:
  - Error Code: HTTP 500
  - Error Message: "Internal Server Error - Sync operation failed"
  - Timestamp pattern: Failures occur during peak hours (9am-11am EST)

  Environment:
  - Desktop Client Version: 2.8.3
  - OS: Windows 11 Pro (22H2)
  - Network: Corporate network with proxy

  Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Open desktop client
  2. Make changes to any document
  3. Wait for auto-sync (or trigger manual sync)
  4. Observe error on ~33% of attempts

  I've attached the client logs and network traces from the failed syncs.

  Please advise on next steps.

  Best,
  David Martinez
