  Dear Billing Team,

  We noticed a discrepancy on our January invoice (INV-2024-0156). We were
  charged for 50 seats but our contract specifies 45 seats at the enterprise
  rate.

  Please review and issue a credit for the 5 extra seats.

  Contract Reference: ENT-2023-789
  Account: Acme Corporation
  Contact: billing@acme.com

  Looking forward to your prompt resolution.

  Regards,
  Michael Chen
  Finance Department
