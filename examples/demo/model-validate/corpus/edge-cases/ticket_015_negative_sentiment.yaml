  THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I'M WRITING ABOUT THIS ISSUE!

  Your support team is completely useless. I've been waiting for OVER A WEEK
  for someone to fix my sync problem and nobody has done ANYTHING.

  I'm paying ENTERPRISE prices for what exactly?! This is absolutely
  unacceptable.

  If this isn't resolved by end of day I'm cancelling our contract and
  moving our entire organization to your competitor.

  I expect a call from a manager IMMEDIATELY.
