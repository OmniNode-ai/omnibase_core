  Hi,

  I'm looking at my account settings and I see two different billing dates
  listed. One says my next charge is Jan 25 and another place shows Feb 1.

  Also, I'm not sure if the payment method on file is still valid since
  I got a new card.

  Can you clarify which date is correct and update my card info?

  Thanks,
  Alex
