## Critical Actions Required

### üî¥ **BLOCKER** - Fix Before Deletion
```bash
# core_uuid_service.py is still imported by 3 files
# Action: Move file and update imports
mv archived/src/omnibase_core/core/core_uuid_service.py \
   src/omnibase_core/utils/uuid_service.py

# Update imports in:
# - src/omnibase_core/models/core/model_core_errors.py
# - src/omnibase_core/models/core/model_onex_internal_input_state.py
# - src/omnibase_core/models/core/model_onex_internal_processing_context.py
```

### üü° **RESTORE** - Valuable Performance Tests
```bash
# Restore performance tests for actively-used models
mkdir -p tests/performance/contracts/
cp archived/tests/performance/core/contracts/test_model_dependency_performance.py \
   tests/performance/contracts/
cp archived/tests/performance/core/contracts/test_model_workflow_dependency_performance.py \
   tests/performance/contracts/

# Move performance testing documentation
mv archived/tests/performance/README.md \
   docs/testing/performance-benchmarks.md
```

### üü¢ **PRESERVE** - High-Value Documentation
```bash
# Create reference documentation structure
mkdir -p docs/reference/{templates,architecture-research,patterns}

# Move valuable templates (258KB)
mv archived/docs/templates/*.md docs/reference/templates/

# Move architecture research (23KB)
mv archived/docs/architecture/*.md docs/reference/architecture-research/

# Move pattern documentation (31KB)
mv archived/docs/circuit_breaker_pattern.md docs/reference/patterns/
mv archived/docs/configuration_management.md docs/reference/patterns/

# Preserve knowledge base
mv archived/knowledge/ docs/reference/mixin-architecture/
```

rm -f archived/tests/performance/core/contracts/__init__.py
```

**Space Recovered**: ~4.5 MB
**Risk**: None - all superseded or obsolete

---

### **Phase 2: After Blocker Resolution**

```bash
# After moving core_uuid_service.py:
rm -rf archived/src/omnibase_core/core/     # 85 files, 25,692 lines
```

**Space Recovered**: ~1 MB
**Risk**: None after UUID service migration

---

### **Phase 3: Models Review** (Manual Review Required)

- `knowledge_graph/` (15 files) - Graph-based knowledge
- `omnimemory/` (14 files) - Memory management, AST analysis
- `knowledge_pipeline/` (5 files) - Knowledge processing

**Action**: Move to `archived/models_reference/` for preservation

#### ‚ùå **Delete** (56 files - 8.5%)
Deprecated domains:
- `hook_events/` (10 files) - Old event system
- `claude_code_responses/` (13 files) - Tool response models
- `conversation/` (8 files) - Old conversation models
- `tool_capture/` (8 files) - Tool capture deprecated
- `consul/` (7 files) - Consul integration unused
- `capture/` (5 files) - Capture functionality
- `canary/` (2 files) - Canary deployments removed
- `sandbox/` (2 files) - Sandbox environment removed
- `conflicts/` (1 file) - Conflict resolution

**Action**: Safe to delete immediately

#### üîç **Review** (308 files - 47.0%)
Needs manual comparison with current `src/omnibase_core/models/`:

## Risk Assessment

| Action | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Delete `archive/src_archived/` | **NONE** | All code fully migrated |
| Delete `archived/core/` (after UUID fix) | **LOW** | One file needs migration first |
| Delete pattern tests | **NONE** | Feature completely removed |
| Delete node tests | **NONE** | Tests for deleted code |
| Restore performance tests | **LOW** | May need import updates |
| Delete obsolete scripts | **NONE** | All superseded or one-time use |
| Models deletion | **MEDIUM** | Requires careful review |

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Today)
1. ‚úÖ Execute Phase 1 deletions (safe, no dependencies)
2. ‚úÖ Preserve high-value documentation
3. ‚úÖ Restore performance tests

### Short-term (This Week)
1. üîß Migrate `core_uuid_service.py` and update imports
2. üóëÔ∏è Execute Phase 2 deletion (core directory)
3. üìù Review and categorize models directory

### Future Considerations
- Consider archiving to git branch instead of keeping in main branch
- Document preserved materials in `docs/reference/README.md`
- Set up automated checks to prevent new files in `archived/`
- Create policy for when/how code gets archived

---

## Conclusion

The archived directories contain a mix of:
- **Fully migrated code** (99% of Python files) ‚Üí Safe to delete
- **Valuable documentation** (~300KB) ‚Üí Preserve in `docs/reference/`
- **Performance tests** (2 files) ‚Üí Restore to active test suite
- **One blocking file** ‚Üí Requires migration before cleanup

**Primary Blocker**: `core_uuid_service.py` migration (30 min fix)

**Recommended Next Step**: Execute Phase 1 deletions immediately, then address UUID service blocker.
