## 1. Node Architecture Analysis

### 1.1 Reference Implementation Standards (omnibase_3)

**Source**: `/Volumes/PRO-G40/Code/omnibase_3/.cursor/rules/node_standards.mdc`

The reference documentation defines a clear 4-node classification system:

#### Node Classifications by Primary Responsibility:

1. **Compute Nodes**: Pure computational operations
   - **Purpose**: Stateless data transformations, mathematical operations
   - **Characteristics**: No side effects, deterministic, cacheable
   - **Examples**: Data transformation, calculations, filtering

2. **Effect Nodes**: Side effect operations  
   - **Purpose**: External interactions, I/O operations
   - **Characteristics**: Non-deterministic, stateful interactions
   - **Examples**: Database operations, API calls, file system access

3. **Reducer Nodes**: Data aggregation operations
   - **Purpose**: Fold, accumulate, merge multiple inputs into single output
   - **Characteristics**: Streaming-capable, conflict resolution
   - **Examples**: Sum, merge, aggregate analytics

4. **Orchestrator Nodes**: Workflow coordination
   - **Purpose**: Control flow, conditional execution, parallel coordination
   - **Characteristics**: Thunk emission, dependency management
   - **Examples**: Workflow engines, conditional branching, load balancing

### 1.2 Current Implementation Analysis (omnibase-core)

**Location**: `/Volumes/PRO-G40/Code/omnibase-core/src/omnibase_core/core/`

#### NodeCoreBase Foundation
All specialized nodes inherit from `NodeCoreBase` providing:

    # Key capabilities:
    - Pure function execution
    - Caching and memoization support  
    - Mathematical operations
    - Data transformations
    - Parallel execution support
```

**2. NodeEffect** (`node_effect.py`)
```python

    """Side effect execution node for external interactions."""

    # Key capabilities:
    - Async operations support
    - I/O and external API calls
    - Database operations
    - Retry logic and circuit breakers

## 2. Contract System Architecture

### 2.1 Contract Loading Infrastructure

**Primary Components:**
- `ContractLoader` (`contract_loader.py`): Unified loading with $ref resolution
- `ContractService` (`contract_service.py`): Service layer with caching and validation
- `ModelContract*` classes: Strongly-typed contract models

#### Contract Loading Workflow:
1. **File Discovery**: Locate contract YAML files with caching
2. **Parsing**: Convert YAML to strongly-typed Pydantic models
3. **Validation**: Validate structure and required fields
4. **Reference Resolution**: Resolve $ref subcontract dependencies
5. **Caching**: Performance optimization with staleness detection
6. **Service Integration**: Inject via ONEXContainer dependency injection

#### Contract Structure:
```yaml
# Standard ONEX Contract Format
contract_version:
  major: 1
  minor: 0  
  patch: 0

node_name: "node_identifier"

tool_specification:
  main_tool_class: "ToolClassName"
  business_logic_pattern: "stateful|stateless"

dependencies:
  - name: "dependency_service"
    type: "service"
    version: "^1.0.0"

# Input/output schemas
input_state: {...}
output_state: {...}
definitions: {...}
```

### 2.2 Contract Validation Patterns

**Validation Layers:**
1. **Structural Validation**: Required fields presence
2. **Semantic Validation**: Tool class references and patterns  
3. **Version Compatibility**: SemVer validation and compatibility
4. **Dependency Resolution**: Service dependency validation

**Error Handling:**
- OnexError with exception chaining for all validation failures
- Comprehensive logging with context for troubleshooting
- Fail-fast pattern for early error detection

## 3. Service Layer Architecture

### 3.1 Node Service Pattern

**Service Classes:**
- `NodeEffectService`: Effect node service capabilities
- `NodeComputeService`: Compute node service capabilities  
- `NodeReducerService`: Reducer node service capabilities
- `NodeOrchestratorService`: Orchestrator node service capabilities

#### Service Composition Pattern:
```python
class NodeEffectService(
    NodeEffect,              # Core node functionality
    MixinNodeService,        # Service lifecycle management
    MixinNodeIdFromContract, # Contract-based node ID loading
    MixinHealthCheck,        # Standardized health checks
):
    """Composed service with multiple capability layers."""
```

### 3.2 Service Lifecycle Management

**Lifecycle Phases:**
1. **Initialization**: Container injection and dependency resolution
2. **Contract Loading**: Load and validate node configuration
3. **Service Registration**: Register with service discovery
4. **Event Subscription**: Subscribe to relevant event patterns
5. **Service Mode**: Enter persistent service mode
6. **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health check reporting
7. **Graceful Shutdown**: Cleanup and resource release

**Service Discovery Integration:**
- ONEXContainer provides dependency injection
- Protocol-based duck typing for service resolution
- Service registry for runtime service location
- Health check monitoring for service availability

## 4. Mixin System Analysis

- `MixinNodeSetup`: Initialization and setup utilities

#### Mixin Categories:

**Lifecycle Mixins:**
- `MixinNodeService`: Service mode and event loop
- `MixinNodeLifecycle`: Startup/shutdown coordination  
- `MixinAutoConnect`: Automatic service connection

**Contract Integration Mixins:**

### 4.2 Mixin Composition Patterns

**Pattern 1: Service-Ready Node Composition**

class NodeTypeService(
    NodeType,                    # Core node functionality
    MixinNodeService,           # Service capabilities
    MixinNodeIdFromContract,    # Contract integration
    MixinHealthCheck,           # Health monitoring
):
    """Full service-ready node with all standard capabilities."""
```

**Pattern 2: Event-Driven Node Composition**
```python
class EventDrivenNode(
    NodeType,
    MixinEventDrivenNode,       # Event handling
    MixinEventListener,         # Event subscription
    MixinIntrospection,         # Runtime introspection
