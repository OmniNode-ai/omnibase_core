"""
Integration and MRO tests for ModelServiceReducer.

Tests the integration of MixinNodeService with NodeReducer and supporting mixins:
- MixinCaching (CRITICAL for Reducer nodes - aggregation result caching)
- MixinHealthCheck (includes state persistence monitoring)
- MixinMetrics

Tests Method Resolution Order (MRO) correctness and mixin interaction patterns.
Focuses on reducer-specific patterns: aggregation, state management, cache invalidation.
