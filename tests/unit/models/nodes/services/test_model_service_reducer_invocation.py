"""
Test suite for ModelServiceReducer tool invocation handling.

Tests reducer-specific semantics including aggregation operations, state management,
cache integration, and event-driven tool execution via TOOL_INVOCATION events.

Test Coverage:
1. Basic tool invocation handling
2. Target node validation
3. Event-to-input-state conversion
4. Tool execution via node.run()
5. Result serialization
6. Success response emission
7. Error response emission
8. Correlation ID tracking
9. Active invocation tracking
10. Concurrent invocations
11. Wrong target node (ignore)
12. Aggregation semantics validation
13. State management during invocation
