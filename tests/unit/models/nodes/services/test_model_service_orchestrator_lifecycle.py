Test Implementation Summary:

✅ 10 Test Cases Implemented (as required):
1. Service initialization - Verifies proper initialization of all state variables
2. Service start (start_service_mode) - Tests startup sequence and dependencies
3. Service stop (stop_service_mode) - Tests graceful shutdown
4. Introspection publishing on startup - Verifies service discovery integration
5. Event subscription to TOOL_INVOCATION - Tests event bus integration for workflow coordination
6. Health monitoring task creation - Verifies health monitoring setup with subnode aggregation
7. Signal handler registration - Tests SIGTERM/SIGINT handling
8. Error handling during startup - Tests failure recovery
9. Multiple start attempts (idempotency) - Tests state management
10. Service restart cycles - Tests lifecycle correctness

Test Classes:
- TestModelServiceOrchestratorInitialization (2 tests)
- TestModelServiceOrchestratorStartup (7 tests)
- TestModelServiceOrchestratorShutdown (5 tests)
- TestModelServiceOrchestratorEventHandling (3 tests)
- TestModelServiceOrchestratorHealthMonitoring (3 tests)
- TestModelServiceOrchestratorRestart (2 tests)
- TestModelServiceOrchestratorSignalHandling (2 tests)

Total: 24 test methods covering all 10 required test cases plus additional edge cases.

Orchestrator-Specific Features Tested:
- Workflow coordination via MixinEventBus
- Event-driven workflow lifecycle management
- Subnode health aggregation (mocked)
- Correlation ID tracking across workflow steps
- Workflow invocation handling with proper context

Testing Patterns Used:
- pytest.mark.asyncio for async tests
- Mock and AsyncMock for dependency injection
- Proper setup/teardown with fixtures
- Context managers for patches
- Comprehensive assertions

All tests follow ONEX patterns and existing codebase conventions.
